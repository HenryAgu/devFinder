# Dev Finder

A web app that gets information about a GitHub user through the GitHub API would allow users to enter a GitHub username and retrieve information about that user, such as their public repositories, followers, and when they joined GitHub. This information could be displayed in a clean and easy-to-read format on the web app, and users could potentially even be able to follow the user or view their repositories directly through the app. This type of app could be useful for anyone looking to get a quick overview of a particular GitHub user's activity or contributions.
